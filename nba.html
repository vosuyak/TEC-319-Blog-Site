                        General manager Sam Presti tried to keep expectations in check when he gave his end-of-season press conference in early May. His Oklahoma City Thunder had just completed a 47-35 effort with a first-round exit, losing to the Houston Rockets in five games. The Thunder finished with the franchise's third-youngest roster.

                        "The age of the team is a great foundation for us in terms of player development," Presti said. "I think we do have to be intentional with the development of the group going forward. Throughout the roster, I think there's opportunity for a lot of different guys to improve and get better."

                        In reality, that was the Thunder's fallback plan. Perhaps a worst-case scenario.

                        As about <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/14/paul-george-oklahoma-city-thunder-russell-westbrook-sam-presti">Sports Illustrated's Lee Jenkins</a> wrote in July, Presti, after the season, handed his staff pictures of MacGyver, the resourceful 1980s TV secret agent with a penchant for solving problems with scotch tape and matchsticksâ€”anything handy. It sent a message that Oklahoma City would have to be creative to improve.

                        The franchise had the 21st pick in the upcoming <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/nba">NBA</a> draft but could not trade another one until 2024. Its young players weren't blue-chip prospects. The Thunder needed to become opportunistic to make significant improvements.

                        Nearly three months after taking a chance on Paul George, the Thunder stunned the NBA again by trading for 10-time All-Star and four-time U.S. Olympian Carmelo Anthony, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and The Vertical's Shams Charania.

                        In a weekend replete with major news, nothing is more important than <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/9/23/16354506/lebron-james-donald-trump-steph-curry-white-house-invitation-warriors">LeBron James calling Donald Trump</a>, the President of the United States, a bum on Twitter. In the tweet above, The King went after The POTUS after the latter revoked Steph Curry's invitation to the White House.

                        The Warriors had been prepared to vote Saturday morning on whether to visit the White House; on Friday, Curry reiterated he was still firmly against the trip and indicated he wouldn't be going in any case, which made Saturday's revoking of the invitation rather hilarious, leading to LeBron's now-famous tweet.

                        Steve Kerr responded in typical eloquent, Steve Kerr fashion with a piece for Sports Illustrated. Players across the league jumped to Curry's defense. The league itself, however, offered only a thin, cautious defense of Curry, and Adam Silver reiterated that he did want the Warriors to go visit Trump. Never did Silver acknowledge specifically why a group of young black men would be really, really opposed to that beyond simple political differences, especially in the wake of Charlottesville. I wrote about that here.

                        Meanwhile the WNBA, which has been at the forefront of sports-based political protest, continued that for Game 1 of the Finals on Sunday. On a day of protest throughout the NFL, both WNBA teams protested police violence and racism during the national anthem and commissioner Lisa Borders spoke about the importance of athletes sharing their opinions.
