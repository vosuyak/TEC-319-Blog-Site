                        Daily News columnist and <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/king-boycotting-nfl-anti-blackness-article-1.3225720"> Black Lives Matter</a> leader Shaun King announced Tuesday he is boycotting the National Football League for allegedly blacklisting Colin Kaepernick.

                        Kaepernick, who started a nationwide trend with his controversial decision to kneel during the pre-game national anthem to protest racial injustice in America, has not been signed by an NFL team since he opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers in March.

                        “I can’t, in good conscience, support this league, with many of its pro-Trump owners, as it blacklists my friend and brother Colin Kaepernick for taking a silent, peaceful stance against injustice and police brutality in America,” King wrote in the Daily News. “It’s disgusting and has absolutely nothing to do with football and everything to do with penalizing a brilliant young man for the principled stance he took last season.”

                        King said Kaepernick remains unsigned because of racism, bigotry and discrimination.

                        SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — On a day when NFL teams grabbed the nation's attention by coordinating demonstrations during the national anthem, a 97-year-old World War II veteran went viral with a solitary show of support for the protests.

                        Brennan Gilmore posted a Twitter picture Sunday morning of his grandfather, John Middlemas, kneeling while wearing a veteran's cap. Gilmore wrote: "My grandpa is a 97 year-old WWII vet & Missouri farmer who wanted to join w/ those who #TakeaKnee: 'those kids have every right to protest.'"

                        Middlemas is a farmer from Willard, Missouri. He tells the Springfield News-Leader he wanted to communicate "that you have to love everybody." He adds: "We don't kill people. We want to make people live."

                        I’ve been vocal in the past about the debate over NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling in protest during the national anthem, but now it’s grown to a new level and so I feel compelled to speak out again. As a combat veteran who played football for much of his life and coached young players, and now as an activist who has been in the media, scrutinized, criticized, and even threatened, I think I have a somewhat unique perspective.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote cite="http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/09/why-trump-should-be-one-stopping-take-knee/141308/">
                        <p>I support the cause, but I'm a combat veteran, so I won't kneel. We still need a leader who brings the temperature down, not cranks it up.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Why i support Kaepernick</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>I support Kaepernick’s goals, and his right to peacefully protest, 100 percent. As a vet, and especially in times like these, I understand and appreciate the overwhelming importance of free speech.</p></li>
                        <li><p>I also respect Kaepernick’s right to protest the anthem as his chosen tactic. There were of course other options that would have also captured attention and generated much-needed debate and conversation, but it was his choice.</p></li>                        
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Yes, of course he can kneel during the anthem. He also could have burned the flag. It’s not the same, of course, except that both are extremely controversial forms of protected speech that hit a special national sweet spot of emotional reactions. And so knowing the country in the ways I do, and knowing so many military, first responders, conservatives and older people as I do, I would have advised Kaepernick to pick another form of protest that wouldn’t have automatically pushed away a high percentage of the people who needed to hear his message the most. By choosing the anthem, in my opinion, the debate is now unfortunately too often about Kaepernick’s tactic and not enough about his message — one that is vital, urgent, and overdue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I was recently invited to participate in a rally for Kaepernick in New York, I respectfully declined. The members of the organization I lead all served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many are opposed to his actions and many support him. It’s a divisive issue for America and for our veterans. However, I think most believe in his right to do it, even those who despise him for doing it. Given that I support Kaepernick’s general message and goals for awareness of race relations and police brutality, I wish he chose something I could do in solidarity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not kneeling during the anthem. Ever. That’s my right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know many of his teammates and supporters feel the same way. It’s not about me, especially given my comparatively privileged position as a white man in America, but if he chose something I could do too, I’d be all in. And I think millions of others would be too. If he comes up with a new tactic — one that allows me to show support for him and his message, without connecting it to the anthem and the flag — I’ll likely be doing it at the next New York Giants home game. And maybe at a West Point home game, too. That’s an opportunity that still exists that’s worth noting. Remember the iconic image of West Point players charging onto the field carrying a French flag after the Paris terrorist attacks of November 2015? Imagine the power of a display from both teams of future military officers at the Army-Navy football game on national TV this December.
