                        The recent surge of national anthem protests in sports has polarized the nation, but at least Bruce Maxwell knows his hometown fans are on his side.

                        While NFL and NBA players have grown increasingly vocal on issues of racial inequality, MLB players have remained relatively quiet. On Saturday, Maxwell, a catcher for the Oakland Athletics, attempted to break that silence, dropping to one knee during the national anthem before a game against the Texas Rangers.

                    <blockquote>
                        "The point of my kneeling is not to disrespect our military," he said, according to Jane Lee of MLB.com. "It's not to disrespect our constitution. It's not to disrespect our country. My hand was over my heart because I love this country. I've had plenty of family members, including my father, that have bled for this country, that continue to serve for this country ... But my kneeling is what is getting the attention, because I'm kneeling for the people who don't have a voice."                        
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Maxwell now joins countless NFL and NBA players in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, who’s been at the center of a controversial protest that condemns the extrajudicial murders and injustices of black and brown peoples in the United States.

                        Maxwell’s decision to kneel came after Donald Trump made reference to NFL players not standing for the anthem as employees who “should be fired by their teams.” Trump’s speech took place on Friday in Huntsville, Ala., where Maxwell grew up.

                        The catcher was warming up starter Sean Manaea, out of view from many fans and cameras. One fan near the Oakland dugout said “boo” in a normal voice, and a small number of fans booed when Maxwell batted in the second inning.

                        Maxwell has been the only major league baseball player to take to a knee, mirroring protests by NFL players against racial injustice. This was Maxwell’s first road game since he began his protest last weekend.

                        A’s manager Bob Melvin said before the game he expected the protest to continue because of Maxwell was committed to it.
