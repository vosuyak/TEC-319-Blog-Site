                            Americans love their favorite sports. We love watching games on television and in person, and we go out of the way to spark up conversations and, at times, arguments with strangers on the Internet all because of the “hot takes” that we have about the sports world. With casual fans in the United States embracing European soccer leagues more and more with each year, those who live to watch live sports during their weekends can now do so for just about every minute that they are awake for the majority of the year. Throw in high-definition television, and it is reasonable to say that US sports fans have never had it better.                    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are, of course, only so many hours in a day, and only so many of those precious moments can be dedicated to following sports for those of us who are not able to sit in front of television sets for the majority of any given day. Because of that, the likes of women’s golf, women’s professional basketball and women’s college basketball, did not manage to crack the list of the top-14 favorite sports among American adults in 2014. Five different sports all begin the list by having the lowest popularity of those who were asked.

                            <p>New name in the game of ballers</p>

                            Los Angeles Lakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball does not have public records of his shoe endorsement with family-owned Big Baller Brand.

                            But because sports are inherently competitive and we have access to the sneaker-endorsement earnings of other top NBA players, many will still try to predict exactly how much he is collecting. Others will wonder how much he would have made if he went a more traditional route.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote cite="http://hoopshype.com/2017/10/04/projected-profit-for-lonzo-ball-zo2-sneaker-with-big-baller-brand/">
                            <q> Using the profit margin per sneaker research conducted by the University of Oregon, for every pair of ZO2 shoes sold, Big Baller Brand could expect to net 9% of the sales price of $495 as profit. Since Big Baller Brand is a family business run by Lonzo’s father, we treated the total profit of the ZO2 shoe sales, $445,500, as the value of Lonzo’s endorsement deal per year.</q>                          
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Sneaker expert Nick DePaula, for example, believes Ball could have seen a check for $15 million if he had signed a five-year deal with a top shoe company.

                            Ball has instead made history on an alternative path, though we may never know if it was the “right” choice.
